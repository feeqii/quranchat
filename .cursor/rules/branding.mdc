# Quran Chat – Branding & Visual Guidelines

Quran Chat is a spiritually respectful AI companion that helps Muslims reflect on the Quran daily. The entire app must feel peaceful, minimalist, emotionally grounded, and trustworthy. The experience should evoke calmness, contemplation, and a sense of divine presence — never clutter, gamification, or hype.

---

## 🎨 Color System

All colors are referenced semantically for flexibility and scaling.

```ts
colors: {
  primary: '#3C8C7E',         // Soft deep green
  primarySoft: '#D9EDE7',     // Light green background
  accent: '#C9A76D',          // Optional gold highlight
  background: '#F8FAF9',
  surface: '#FFFFFF',

  textPrimary: '#1F2A2E',
  textSecondary: '#4A5B60',
  textMuted: '#889396',

  success: '#4CAF50',
  warning: '#FBC02D',
  danger: '#D32F2F',
}
```

---

## 🖋 Typography

Use generous line height, clean spacing, and font sizes that support calm readability. Use no more than **two fonts** throughout the app.

```ts
fonts: {
  heading: 'Poppins-Bold',
  body: 'Poppins-Regular',
}

fontSizes: {
  h1: 28,
  h2: 22,
  h3: 18,
  body: 16,
  small: 14,
}
```

Typography tone:
- Clear, clean, and welcoming
- Never techy, gamified, or sarcastic
- Every word must feel intentional and gentle

---

## 📐 Spacing & Layout Tokens

Use standardized spacing and radius throughout the app:

```ts
spacing: {
  xs: 4,
  sm: 8,
  md: 16,
  lg: 24,
  xl: 32,
}

radii: {
  sm: 6,
  md: 12,
  lg: 20,
  full: 9999,
}
```

**Buttons** and **cards** should use `radii.lg` by default.

---

## 🕊 Motion & Feedback

Motion should be barely noticeable — used only to reinforce clarity, not to entertain.

```ts
animations: {
  transition: 'ease-out',
  duration: 300ms,
  default: fade + slide (Y offset 20),
}

haptics: {
  tap: light,
  success: medium,
}
```

Avoid:
- Bounce, scale-up, or elastic transitions
- Vibrant "pop" interactions
- Lottie animations unless spiritual + slow

---

## 🧘 Tone & Copy

Spoken tone should feel like a wise, gentle companion — not an app or assistant.

### Examples of Acceptable Voice:
- ✅ "Let’s reflect on this Ayah together"
- ✅ "What’s on your mind today?"
- ✅ "This verse may bring you peace"

### Avoid:
- ❌ "Ask me anything!"
- ❌ "Ready to unlock your potential?"
- ❌ Over-casual or tech/startup lingo

---

## 🧩 Iconography & Illustrations

- Use **minimal** Islamic geometric shapes — no realism
- Icon sets: Lucide, Feather, or custom outlined SVGs
- Illustration style: flat, pastel, abstract — not cartoonish
- No faces or people unless symbolic silhouettes
- Acceptable icons: `book`, `star`, `heart`, `moon`, `light`, `quote`

---

## 🧑🏽 Audience Profile

| Trait | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Age | 16–35 |
| Religion | Primarily Muslim |
| Device | iOS (Gen Z / Millennials) |
| Goals | Strengthen spirituality, learn Quran, build habits |
| Style Preference | Clean, intentional, aesthetic apps (Calm, Headspace, Stoic) |

---

## 🧭 General UX Principles

- Use plenty of white space
- Only one core action per screen
- Avoid showing too many options at once
- Every touchpoint should feel like a pause, not a transaction
- Assume the user is mentally tired and seeking peace
