description: This ruleset defines standards and best practices for integrating Amplitude analytics into the Quran Chat React Native app. It covers SDK setup, event naming conventions, state management, and privacy considerations to ensure consistent, scalable, and compliant data collection.

📦 Folder & File Structure  
- **store/useAnalyticsStore.ts**  
  - Central Zustand slice for logging events.  
  - Exports a single `logEvent(event: AnalyticsEvent)` method.  
- **App.tsx**  
  - Import and initialize Amplitude once at app startup.  
- **navigation/**  
  - Instrument `screen_view` in your root navigator.  
- **Components & Screens**  
  - Call `logEvent` within `useEffect` or event handlers.

🔧 SDK Installation  
- Must install `@amplitude/react-native`.  
- In `App.tsx` (or equivalent entry), call:
  ```ts
  import { Amplitude } from '@amplitude/react-native';
  Amplitude.getInstance().init('<AMPLITUDE_API_KEY>');
No multiple initializations—only once, at top of the app.

📈 Event Taxonomy & Naming

Screen Views: screen_view

Props: { screenName: string }

Onboarding:

onboarding_start (no props)

onboarding_complete_step { step: number }

onboarding_finish

Paywall:

paywall_view

paywall_subscribe_tap

paywall_purchase_success

paywall_purchase_failure { error: string }

paywall_restore_tap

Subscription:

subscription_entitlement_granted

subscription_entitlement_restored

subscription_entitlement_expired

Core Features:

verse_lookup { surah: string; verse: number }

reflection_generated

mood_checkin { mood: string; context: string }

context_selected { context: string }

language_switch { from: string; to: string }

Naming Rules:

All event names are snake_case.

Use clear, action-oriented verbs.

Include contextual props for filtering and funnels.

🔗 State Management

All analytics calls must go through useAnalyticsStore.

Do not scatter direct Amplitude.getInstance().logEvent(...) calls outside the store.

The store’s logEvent should unpack an event union type and forward to Amplitude.

🌍 Privacy & Compliance

Anonymous Tracking Only: Do not attach or collect PII.

No user emails/usernames: All events logged without user or device IDs beyond Amplitude’s default anonymized IDs.

GDPR/CCPA: Ensure opt-out mechanism is in place (e.g., respect doNotTrack).

🧪 Testing & Validation

Dev Mode: Enable Amplitude.getInstance().setUseDeviceMode() if needed.

Verify: After integration, exercise each flow and confirm events appear in Amplitude’s Live View.

QA: Track all event names exactly as defined—missing or mis-typed names should fail build-time TS checks on the AnalyticsEvent union.
