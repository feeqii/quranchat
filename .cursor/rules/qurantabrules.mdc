QURAN CHAT â€” QURAN TAB RULES
ðŸ“– Purpose
This ruleset governs everything related to the Quran reading and exploration experience within the Quran tab.

It covers the Quran browsing screen, Surah selection interface, verse reading screen, translation selection, and any state, navigation, or UI logic directly connected to Quran browsing and reading. Cursor must refer to this file before generating any feature that touches the Quran tab.

ðŸ§  Functional Scope
Screens Covered
QuranHomeScreen (shows Surah list or recent Surah)

SurahSelectionModal (modal for selecting Surah)

VerseReadingScreen (individual Surah with verses)

TranslationSelectionModal (translation picker)

User Flow
QuranHomeScreen shows:

Current or last viewed Surah

Option to open Surah selection modal

Option to select translation

Selecting Surah immediately navigates to VerseReadingScreen

User can select and switch translations smoothly

Smooth navigation and intuitive state management for Surah/translation selection

ðŸ§± Component Architecture
Atoms
IconButton â€“ standard tappable icon wrapper

VerseNumber â€“ stylized circular verse number

TranslationBadge â€“ indicates active translation

Molecules
VerseCard â€“ single verse block with Arabic and translation

SurahListItem â€“ Surah selection list item

TranslationOption â€“ selectable translation option row

Organisms
SurahList â€“ scrollable list of Surahs with search functionality

TranslationSelector â€“ manages translation selection flow

Layouts
All screens use SafeAreaView, FlatList, or ScrollView

Consistent spacing, typography, and colors from theme.ts

All text via <Typography> atom (variant-based)
ðŸ”€ Navigation Logic
Screens registered exclusively in AppNavigator.tsx or dedicated QuranStackNavigator.tsx

Surah selection via modal navigation:

Modal opens with navigation.navigate("SurahSelectionModal")

Immediately close modal upon Surah selection

Navigation to verse reading via navigation.navigate("VerseReadingScreen")

Translation selection via modal (TranslationSelectionModal):

Sets global translation state in useQuranStore

ðŸ§ƒ State Management
Global Quran state handled by:

useQuranStore.ts

selectedSurah: number | null

selectedTranslation: string

setSurah(surahNumber: number)

setTranslation(translationKey: string)

clearSurah()

Local states (e.g., loading, search queries) handled via useState hooks within screens.

All Quran API requests handled via /lib/api/quranAPI.ts.

ðŸŽ¯ Design Rules
Never use raw hex values â€” always theme.colors

No hardcoded spacing or font sizes â€” always use theme.spacing and <Typography>

Strict adherence to atomic component structure (Atoms â†’ Molecules â†’ Organisms)

Reuse existing components where applicable; extend thoughtfully if necessary

ðŸ§­ Summary
This ruleset is the single source of truth for all screens and features under the "Quran" tab. Cursor must strictly follow these rules when generating:

Screens

Components

State slices

Navigation updates

Layout or style logic

Violations or workarounds are not allowed unless explicitly approved.
