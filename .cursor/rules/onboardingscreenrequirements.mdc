# Quran Chat – Onboarding Screen Requirements

This file defines each onboarding screen in order. It includes the screen's purpose, UI components used, what data is collected and saved to Zustand, and the next screen in the flow.

All screens must use shared components from the design system (see `component_library.md`). No inline styling or logic duplication.
